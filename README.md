# RomCom  

### Abstract:
[//]: <> (Briefly describe what you built and its features. What problem is the app solving? How does this application solve that problem?)
- We built a website that generates random romantic novel covers or allows the user to create their own.
- The user can save covers and view their saved covers on a seperate page. Saved covers can also be deleted by double clicking on them
- The features inclide a home page, a saved library, and a create book form. 
- This appplication allows the user to have fun creating unique covers to books with their own images, titles and descriptions. The user can also view randomized covers for inspiration. 

### Installation Instructions:
[//]: <> (What steps does a person have to take to get your app cloned down and running?)
- The user only needs the url: file:///Users/alexavsdb/turing/mod1/projects/RomCom-PairedProject-AndreaAndAlexa/index.html
- This url accesses the site and all functionality. If the user wants to edit the application they can fork and clone the repository from GitHub
### Preview of App:
[//]: <> (Provide ONE gif or screenshot of your application - choose the "coolest" piece of functionality to show off.)

### Context:
[//]: <> (Give some context for the project here. How long did you have to work on it? How far into the Turing program are you?)
- We are in Mod 1 - Week 2, we worked on this project over 4 days and spent about 13 hours each (2 people total) on the project. 

### Contributors:

### Learning Goals:
[//]: <> (What were the learning goals of this project? What tech did you work with?)
- We worked with reading HTML and CSS and wrting JavaScript to interact with the HTML and CSS using the DOM interface to communicate between the two/three
- Learning Goals were to:
1. Write clean DRY javascript
2. Collaborate well to write code together and ensure both team memebers were heard (Write code collaboratively)
3. Write clean, DRY JavaScript
4. Explore the connection between HTML, CSS, and JavaScript


### Wins + Challenges:
[//]: <> (What are 2-3 wins you have from this project? What were some challenges you faced - and how did you get over them?)
**WINS!**
We figured out iteration 4 (deleting saved covers) together and we understood the code for that iteration the best as well as having the best collaboration for the entire project while working on it. We also did a good job of working together AND working seperatley. When we worked indepenedently we were able to dive deep into concepts and then teach them to eachother. Alexa was super stoked to figure out how to switch page views in iteration 1! Andrea was stoked that after deleting all her code by accident she was able to recreate that code really quickly and better than it was before!

**challenges**
Working on a team in the begininng was tricky becasue we had to learn eachothers communication styel AND the material at the same time. We overcame it by keeping an open mind and stepping back when we needed to. This allowed us to stay engaged with the material and eachother. Another challenge we faced was this project had a LOT more self teach and we often felt we didn't know what we needed to know. This made the project harder becuase it was hard to research something when we didn't fully understand the base concepts that we were researching off of. For example knowing to look at the bubbling lesson for iteration 4 or understanding the DOM enough to resarch how to use it. We overcame this by asking for help from rocks, and classmates and instructors who could point us inteh right direction. AND GOOGLE!
