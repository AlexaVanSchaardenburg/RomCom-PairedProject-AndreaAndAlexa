# RomCom  

### Abstract:
[//]: <> (Briefly describe what you built and its features. What problem is the app solving? How does this application solve that problem?)
- We built a website that generates random romantic novel covers or allows the user to create their own.
- The user can save covers and view their saved covers on a seperate page. Saved covers can also be deleted by double clicking on them
- The features inclide a home page, a saved library, and a create book form. 
- This appplication allows the user to have fun creating unique covers to books with their own images, titles and descriptions. The user can also view randomized covers for inspiration.
